Although I'm for some reason not proud to admit it, I spend a disportionate amount of time scrolling on Reddit (mostly on [/r/funny](www.reddit.com/r/funny), a great place for a light laugh). I'm also an very happy user of Google Chrome, which performs well on my computer and whose extensibility I love. I've been using [Imagus](https://tiny.cc/Imagus) to accelerate my browsing -- the extension enlarges images that are hovered over or insets images whose URLs are included on a page. Super handy for Reddit. The problem I encountered is that sometimes I actually want to look at the original Imgur page hosting an image, or I want to watch a YouTube video, or perform some other action that requires visiting an entire separate site. I hate having to use my mouse, so when Reddit links open in the same tab and then I have to return to the same page, I get annoyed. 

I solved this world-altering problem by writing a Chrome extension. I've been meaning to tinker with them for a while, and this was as good as any. Figuring out how to properly populate the extension's manifest file was easy, and that was the hardest part. The JavaScript required, using jQuery, was 3 lines, and I'm certain it could be shorter.

You can find the code [on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/greensam/RedditLinkFixer) and find the extension [on the Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redditlinkfixer/gobhdbmnmdkomobedpcmhljkoklakabj).
