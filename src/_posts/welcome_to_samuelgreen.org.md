## Back from the Dead

I have a long history of blogging. Sadly, my history of not blogging is just as distinguished: each of my past attempts has ended a cleverly title chronicle of my life slowly drifting into oblivion. Here we are again.

As is periodically my custom, I realized earlier this weekend that it's rather shameful as a developer to have a poor web presence of my own. I was therefore inspired to once again revamp my personal website -- after all, I have this fancy URL, so I may as well use it. I wanted to get back to blogging, as well, and I realized that my rails site really wasn't going to let me do that simply.

I figured, why not take this moment to investigate something more light weight. I stumbled upon flim and shapeshed.com from @shapeshed, and here we are. Also a chance to practice my markdown. 

I'm not sure where I want this blog to go, but I know already that writing again will bring a much needed dose of catharsis. I'm working my first job in industry as a developer right now, so there might be some posts about that, but I've also found in college that my expository writing skills (i.e. writing down my godforsaken opinions) have dulled a bit as I've dedicated more energy to the quantitive arts. So there'll be some of that too. 

I hope you'll stick around for the ride.
