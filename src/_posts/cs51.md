Welcome to CS51 Code Review! I'm super excited to have you here. I'll be posting my code review materials at this site throughout the course.

A few administrative details:

- You should feel free to email me with any questions you have or for points of clarification.
- If you have conceptual questions for me as your TF (I _might_ even answer pset questions :) ), email me at my @college.
- If you have administrative questions, or questions that would be better answered by me as the course's head TF, email me and Emily at [cs51heads@gmail.com](mailto:cs51heads@gmail.com).

Here are the first code review slides, which are a `git` tutorial. [PDF](/assets/cs51/cr1.pdf) [KEYNOTE](/assets/cs51/cr1.key) [PPTX](/assets/cs51/cr1.pptx)

### Code Review 2: February 16, 2016

You can find materials for today's class in [this BitBucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/greensam/51-codereview). Time to practice your Git!
